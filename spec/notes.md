## questions

- not sure if the the product of the form is a single "annotation" with properties
- or if each property itself should be considered an annotation (that could be standalone) but optionally part of a "set" / "template"
- what happens when you want to annotation a website you've already annotated?
  - option to add more properties to your existing annotation(set)
  - or create a different set of annotations?
- what happens when I pull up another template and it includes properties that I've already filled? they could be auto-populated?
  - makes me think that properties should have IDs so can check for equivalence and avoid redundant duplication
  - so that when you pull up a form, it can check for existing properties filled (show which form it was provided in?)
