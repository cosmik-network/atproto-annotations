# 📌 Structured Annotation: Key Terminology Overview

---

## 📝 Structured Annotation

A general-purpose container used to capture structured information about any web content. It aggregates various forms of user input, including evaluations, tagging, reactions, and personal notes.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Structured, numerical, or categorical assessments of content based on predefined dimensions or criteria. Common types include:

- **Ratings**: Numeric evaluations (e.g., star ratings: 1–5).
- **Dyads**: Evaluations along a spectrum between two extremes (e.g., simple ↔ complex).
- **Triads**: Evaluations positioned within a triangle of three dimensions (e.g., theoretical, practical, societal).
- **Single-select**: User selects exactly one choice from a set of options.
- **Multi-select**: User selects multiple relevant choices from a set of predefined options.

## ✅ Criteria (Dimensions)

Attributes or aspects upon which the content is evaluated. These dimensions guide the structured evaluation and can be numeric, categorical, or spectrum-based (dyads and triads).

---

## 🏷️ Tags (Structured Markers)

Short labels or descriptive keywords applied to content. Useful for quick categorization, filtering, and content discovery.

---

## 👍 Reactions

Simple, expressive evaluations typically conveyed through emoji or icons (e.g., 👍, ❤️, 😮). They allow rapid, low-effort user interaction.

---

## 📚 Curations (Collections)

Sets or groups of annotated items organized purposefully by users, providing structure, priority, and context. Collections help users organize and share annotated content around meaningful themes.

---

## 🗒️ Notes (Annotations & Highlights)

Free-text commentary provided by the user to add context, interpretation, or personal insights, optionally referencing specific highlighted portions of the content.

---

## 📋 Annotation Form

The interactive interface through which users create structured annotations. The form guides users through structured inputs based on predefined or custom templates.

---

## 🗂️ Annotation Templates

Predefined schemas specifying the structure of annotations, including evaluations, criteria, available tags, reactions, and selections (single/multi-select). Templates standardize structured annotations, making data consistent and easier to analyze.

---

## 🌐 Content Profile

The collective structured annotations associated with a specific piece of web content, providing a summary and aggregated insights based on multiple user annotations.
